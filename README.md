# Styling a checkbox

Checkboxes aren't normally stylable in CSS. What we need to do is...

**Create a stylish version of a checkbox using HTML and CSS.**
This involves making square divs (maybe with rounded corners and using a HTML checkmark within those divs.

**Make that checkbox check and uncheck the actual checkbox upon being clicked.**
The JavaScript will change the class name of the divs (between *on* and *off*) and check/uncheck the actual checkboxes.

**Hide the actual checkboxes.**
Just set the *display* property to *none*.
